This is my resume on html format, you can see it here: https://licontre.github.io/

Using this static web page you can perform some actions on your cv.

- You can replace the color of the resume. It just replace the css variable --primary with the value of the color input html5colorpicker
- You can download the resume on pdf format. What it does is to do like a screenshot of the current page and download it on a pdf file.
  Becuase of that we have to fit the html content in the output format, thats why we open a new window when we want to download it, because with that new window size we can fit properly the content.
